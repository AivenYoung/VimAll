# VimAll
__My own configuration of VIM (version >= 8.0).__

* The "plugin.vim" is prepared in directory ".vim/plugin". All plug-in scripts will be auto-loaded when perform ":PlugInstall" in VIM. 
* The "molokai.vim" is prepared in directory ".vim/colors". It's the color-scheme I used.
* Gtags can be download at the website [GNU GLOBAL](http://www.gnu.org/software/global/download.html), and should be intalled.
* YouCompleteMe will be auto-loaded by "plugin.vim" but not installed. You should install it according to the NOTE at the website [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe).
